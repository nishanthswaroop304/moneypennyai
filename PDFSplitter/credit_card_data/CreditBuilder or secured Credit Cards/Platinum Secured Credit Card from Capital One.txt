How does the security deposit work?
* A security deposit helps to establish the credit limit on your Platinum Secured Credit Card. By using your card responsibly and making on-time payments, you may be able to improve your credit score and be considered for a credit line increase in as little as six months. There are three simple steps involved with making your security deposit
* Make Your Deposit, Open Your Account. A $49, $99 , or $200 minimum deposit opens your account with an initial credit line of $200.
* Deposit More, Raise Your Credit Line. You can raise your initial credit line by depositing more than the minimum amount (up to a maximum limit of $1000).
* Use Your Card Responsibly, Get Your Deposit Back. With responsible card use, like making payments on time, you could earn back your deposit and upgrade to an unsecured Platinum card
