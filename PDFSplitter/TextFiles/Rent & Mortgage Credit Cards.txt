* Cellular Telephone Protection: Cellular Telephone Protection can reimburse the eligible Bilt World Elite Mastercard® Credit Card cardholder for damage to, theft of, or involuntary and accidental parting of a cell phone. This is supplemental coverage not otherwise covered by another insurance policy (for example, cell phone insurance programs, or your homeowner’s, renter’s, automobile, or employer’s insurance policies) and may be applied after all other insurance is exhausted. Reimbursement is limited to the cost to repair or replace your original cell phone, less a $25 deductible with an allowable maximum of two paid claims per 12-month period. Each approved claim has a benefit limit of $800. Setting up automatic payments is not required to qualify for Cellular Telephone Protection; however, you need to pay your monthly cell phone bill with your eligible Bilt World Elite Mastercard Credit Card to get up to $800 protection.
* Purchase Security: Coverage in excess of any other coverage, and receipt and other documentation are needed. Benefit may be used in the event of theft or damage of the eligible item. Theft or damage must occur within the first 90 days from the date of purchase, and eligible item must be purchased entirely with your Bilt World Elite Mastercard®. Benefit is paid at Benefit Administrator's discretion. A maximum benefit amount and certain restrictions and limitations apply. Please review the Bilt World Elite Mastercard® Guide to Benefits for details.
* Trip Cancellation & Interruption Protection: Cardholders can receive reimbursement for the cost of scheduled common carrier passenger fare in the event the trip must be canceled or interrupted because of a covered reason. The entire fare, less redeemable certificates, vouchers, or coupons, must be paid with your Bilt World Elite Mastercard.
* Trip Delay Reimbursement: Coverage is provided in excess of other insurances for reimbursement of trip delay expenses incurred after the initial delay of 6 hours, up to $200 per day per covered traveler and up to a maximum amount of $1,800 for all covered travelers per trip, when a trip delay is caused by an eligible reason. Coverage begins on the trip departure date and ends on the trip completion date. Eligible trip delay expenses are covered for you, your spouse or domestic partner and your dependent children traveling on the trip, when you charge the covered traveler’s trip to your eligible Wells Fargo credit card.
* Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver: Certain terms, conditions and exclusions apply. In order for coverage to apply, you must use your covered Bilt World Elite Mastercard® to secure transactions. Please refer to your Bilt World Elite Mastercard® Guide to Benefits for details.

The rides must be paid for with an eligible World or World Elite Mastercard credit card (Apple Card is not eligible for this program, but Apple Pay or Google Pay may be eligible if your World or World Elite Mastercard credit card is the funding source).
